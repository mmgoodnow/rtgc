# Imports in server code

We are using `node --experimental-transform-types` without a transpilation step, so 
- all relative imports should end in a .ts extension to properly resolve.
- all imports of types should be prefixed with `type`, like `import { type FooOptions } from './bar.ts'` because otherwise they will cause a not found error
